          >The Politics of Non-Representation is a two-sided broadsheet poster
          that imagines blank spaces within graphic design as—not empty
          but—vitally alive portals through which marginalized persons can
          disrupt, annotate, or trouble dominant logics. The work includes an
          essay contrasting postcolonial thinker Gayatri Spivak, critical
          designer Jan Van Toorn, and Modernist designers. And the poster
          explores two visual ways of marking blank-ness: the intentionally
          blank page, refigured as a space reserved for future marginal speech;
          and the anti-collage, a layered dis-assemblage of existing visual
          material that evokes absence.

          >Times Neutral Roman (TNR) is an experiment in refusing gendered
          language. Whenever a word or adjective phrase that references a
          particular sex or social gender is written, the typeface will
          automatically substitutes an unspecified marker (an X’d rectangle).
          The marker is a small gap in language—a portal—that makes the writer
          aware of the use of gendered language, which may be composed
          instinctively, without reflective deliberation.

          apart.

          >Fans are commonly used to simply fan off heat but also act as props
          especially in East Asian performances, sometimes as extensions of
          one’s arm in a dance or a mask to obscure one‘s identity. In
          reflecting upon these acts, I used the fan as a form of publication,
          printing lines from Hyejin Shim's article “questions on (the limits &
          effects of) (asian american) allyship” on each fold of the fan.

          >It‘s the Real Thing is a visual exploration of our fetishization of
          nostalgia. We covet the “good old days” as some golden standard of
          living, but in doing so we separate those times from the greater
          contexts they existed within. War & violence, prejudice, inequality —
          all these things are lost within a fever dream of happy childhoods and
          good times with friends.
