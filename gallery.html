      Risd Graphic Design Triennial 2021: A passage, a window, an entrance, an exit, a threshold, a
      transition: it is through these portals that the Risd community experienced the
      past three years. We moved between physical and virtual spaces, projected
      ours and others’ voices throughout nationwide social and racial unrest,
      and oscillated between reflections on the past and present, and
      speculations about new futures. We entered social spaces, classrooms, and
      work environments through the lenses of TikToks, tweets, and tiny video
      grids. We sustained epistemological reckonings and “new normals” as the
      separations between home/work, public/private blurred together. The 2021
      Graphic Design Triennial is an exhibit of works produced within Risd’s Graphic Design
      Department over the last three years, as they sit at the intersections of
      disciplines, visions, and practices. Portals enable both transportation
      and transformation—as visual communicators, we open portals into new ways
      of disrupting and educating. And as we travel through and across
      portals—from a volatile past towards a hazy, but hopeful, future—we must
      embrace the uncertain, constantly iterative process of that transition.
      Against a background of profound social, technological, and ecological
      change, our recent efforts have created new portals and our continued
      vigor and vigilance will ensure they remain open.
      <br>
      This exhibition is a testament to the ever-evolving state of design and
        its endless potential: a pathway to the many worlds we’ve been to before
        and a portal to the infinite places we will eventually go.<br><br>

          during the Fall semester of 2020. Designed as a tribute to
          Müller-Brockmann and the Swiss Style, the poster uses a vertical grid
          system, a deep orange colored title (inspired by the cover of
          Müller-Brockmann's Grid Systems book) and a neutral grotesk font.
          Further symbols like the white arrows where distributed across the
          poster as graphic elements, calling back to Müller-Brockmann’s
          redesign of the Swiss metro system signage. The poster also includes
          an essay detailing Müller-Brockmann’s works and his life.

          >As technology has advanced, people have become more accustomed to
          texting each other. My work has been also done by using a computer,
          which is adobe illustrator and photosho. However, added my touch to it
          by drawing a tiger. How about writing a handwritten letter to a person
          you miss? Sometimes some analog sensibility is must needed in a
          relationship.

          One Warm Day is a poster for a theoretical concert featuring music
          artists Fleet Foxes, Fleetwood Mac, Amigo the Devil, and Orville Peck.
          These artists are united by their folk and country influences, so the
          accompanying animation was made by projecting a slow-moving
          composition onto moving water, and recording the resulting reflection.
          This allowed for really organic movement, creating a soft place for
          viewers to land and reinforcing the idea of one warm day (from Fleet
          Foxes‘ song Featherweight.)

          it’s often viewed as such. Acknowledging the labor and love that is
          required from all of our peers, we hope to impart the participants
          with a more holistic view of what design and community can be. This
          workshop invites young emerging/student designers but is open to all
          cultural workers.

          In this alphabet, Mixer aims to get rid of the hierarchy of uppercase
          and lowercase letters, setting them at the same volume. It respects
          the structural differences and inequalities while pursuing an
          inner-connected complex assemblage. The new closed relationship, the
          intertwined structure that comes with this middle case here is a

          >The Politics of Non-Representation is a two-sided broadsheet poster
          that imagines blank spaces within graphic design as—not empty
          but—vitally alive portals through which marginalized persons can
          disrupt, annotate, or trouble dominant logics. The work includes an
          essay contrasting postcolonial thinker Gayatri Spivak, critical
          designer Jan Van Toorn, and Modernist designers. And the poster
          explores two visual ways of marking blank-ness: the intentionally
          blank page, refigured as a space reserved for future marginal speech;
          and the anti-collage, a layered dis-assemblage of existing visual
          material that evokes absence.

          >It‘s the Real Thing is a visual exploration of our fetishization of
          nostalgia. We covet the “good old days” as some golden standard of
          living, but in doing so we separate those times from the greater
          contexts they existed within. War & violence, prejudice, inequality —
          all these things are lost within a fever dream of happy childhoods and
          good times with friends.

          student fashion sense. The zine also serves as an accompanying tool to
          the article I wrote, featured in The Glob RISD Newspaper (2021). This
          limited edition zine was printed on the risograph and spiral bound
          with a clear coil. The zine features a fold out riso copy of the
          newspaper article at the back.</span

          >To kick off the year, DSIII students created posters (based on the
          idea of taxonomy) that were transformed into public installation
          pieces. This work is particularly meaningful to me because it involves
          the community, and not just because of the interactive collage aspect.
          From ordering custom fluorescent chalk markers from Micheal B. at the
          RISD Store to talking to Peter at the 3D store about cut orders for
          acrylic sheets to learning how to vinyl cut from Ed and John at the
          type shop, this piece would not have been possible without the help of
          the RISD community.

          people collect, study, or worship. It explores parallels between
          Romantic and Transcendental appreciation for nature and those of more
          institutional religious rituals. The cold epistemology of modern
          scientific viewpoints adds extra dimension to the collection, as these
          objects exist at intersections between spirituality and science,
          pulling us both toward nature and separating us from it.

          lens, Google Translate, Photoshop filters, and an OCR system, the
          meaning of each word is transformed. The final “image,” is a poem in
          English, sometimes humorous, sometimes incomprehensible, which
          reflects the abstract nature of translation.
