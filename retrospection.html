          during the Fall semester of 2020. Designed as a tribute to
          Müller-Brockmann and the Swiss Style, the poster uses a vertical grid
          system, a deep orange colored title (inspired by the cover of
          Müller-Brockmann's Grid Systems book) and a neutral grotesk font.
          Further symbols like the white arrows where distributed across the
          poster as graphic elements, calling back to Müller-Brockmann’s
          redesign of the Swiss metro system signage. The poster also includes
          an essay detailing Müller-Brockmann’s works and his life.
