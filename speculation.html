          One Warm Day is a poster for a theoretical concert featuring music
          artists Fleet Foxes, Fleetwood Mac, Amigo the Devil, and Orville Peck.
          These artists are united by their folk and country influences, so the
          accompanying animation was made by projecting a slow-moving
          composition onto moving water, and recording the resulting reflection.
          This allowed for really organic movement, creating a soft place for
          viewers to land and reinforcing the idea of one warm day (from Fleet
          Foxes‘ song Featherweight.)

          >The Poster mimics blotter acid (LSD) but instead of dwelling on the
          psychedelic implications of such an object, this edible poster aims to
          question the ways in which we conform to the collective ritual of
          consuming information - figuratively and literally in this case. I'll
          make a specific portal-theme design for this edible blotter poster,
          which can urge us to think of where we want to go on the ‘trip’
          through this portal - to which preferred future? What does it look
          like? What is RISD like in that future?

          and Nina Jun Yuchi in response and critique to the design industry and
          its relationship with politics. Design is not an isolated process but
          it’s often viewed as such. Acknowledging the labor and love that is
          required from all of our peers, we hope to impart the participants
          with a more holistic view of what design and community can be. This
          workshop invites young emerging/student designers but is open to all
          cultural workers.

          In this alphabet, Mixer aims to get rid of the hierarchy of uppercase
          and lowercase letters, setting them at the same volume. It respects
          the structural differences and inequalities while pursuing an
          inner-connected complex assemblage. The new closed relationship, the
          intertwined structure that comes with this middle case here is a
